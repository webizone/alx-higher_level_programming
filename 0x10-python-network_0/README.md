# Python - Network #0

In this networking project, I used curl in Bash scripts to send various types of HTTP headers. In the process, I learned about how URL's work, domain names, the many different HTTP request/repsonse header fields and status codes, and how to utilize cookies.

Task six was an algorithm challenge separate from the overall project theme completed in Python.

# Tasks

NOTE: The curl behavior in all Bash scripts were written to interact with a server set up on a container provided by 

  * 0. cURL body size ###### 0-body_size.sh:
    Bash script that sends a GET request to a given URL and displays the size of the response body in bytes.

  * 1. cURL to the end
      - ###### 1-body.sh: Bash script that sends a GET request to a given URL and displays the response body for a 200 status code response.
